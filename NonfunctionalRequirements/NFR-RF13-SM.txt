REQ-ID: NFR-RF13-SM
Description: The response to the customerâ€™s query (list possible events for ticket purchase by date range) shall be prompt.
Type: Non-Functional-Performance
Rationale: The game sponsors wish to encourage customers to buy tickets to more than one event, fast response times can keep their interest piqued.
Fit criterion: The response time shall not exceed 2 seconds for 95 percent of queries, and 3 seconds for the remainder.
Originator: Sonam Mishra (Project Manager)
Comments: [SM] Created NFR for RF13
[WH] For the response time, Is this measuring the time it takes the system to process the query or the time it takes to deliver the query results to the customer? It maybe difficult to normalize the time it takes to deliver results to the customer due to variations in the network quality and speeds for each individual session.
