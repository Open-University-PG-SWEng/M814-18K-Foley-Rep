Comments: [JS] I think the phrase 'fewest clicks/interactions' needs to be made tangible/measurable, e.g. 3 clicks from main screen.
[PB] as mentioned by [JS] "fewest clicks/interactions as possible" is not really measurable. We need to define some quantifiable target (number of some sorts that we aim for).
