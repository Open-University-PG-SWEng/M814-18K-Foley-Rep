Description: The system will provide an simple interface that allows customers to browse lists events based on category.
Type: 11 (Usability and Humanity)
Rationale: Users should be able to easily browse and locate specific events of interest based on broad sport categories, an easy to navigate interface will provide a better user experience and potentially increase ticket sales.
Fit Criterion: Average users should be able to navigate to event listings in less than two minutes, using the fewest clicks/interactions as possible.

Comments: [JS] I think the phrase 'fewest clicks/interactions' needs to be made tangible/measurable, e.g. 3 clicks from main screen.
[PB] as mentioned by [JS] "fewest clicks/interactions as possible" is not really measurable. We need to define some quantifiable target (number of some sorts that we aim for).
[LCM] Be careful using the term average, as it can be rather vague. Choosing a strata or model customer can make it easier to work out if the criterion has been met or not
