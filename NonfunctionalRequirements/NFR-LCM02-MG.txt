NFR-REQ-ID: 	NFR-LCM02
Description:	Only authorised personnel shall have access to the pool of tickets for reallocation via the 		reallocation program	
Type:		15 Security
Rationale:	To ensure that seats that have become available are managed and allocated consistently to 		customers on the waiting list for the customer reallocation program
Fit Criterion:	80% of users with permission shall be able to access the reallocation program 
Originator:	Polly Gray (Domestic ticket sales)
Comments:	[MG] Assumption that 80% is an acceptable value for stakeholders to be satisfied that the 				functionality is working as expected.
			[PSHE] 80% is quite a low acceptable value for access to the program - I think it should be higher as this feature should work a significant majority of the time,
			perhaps 95%.
