NFR-REQ-ID: 	NFR-LCM02
Description:	Only authorised personnel shall have access to the pool of tickets for reallocation via the reallocation program	
Type:		12 Performance
Rationale:	To ensure that seats that have become available are managed and allocated consistently to customers on the waiting list for the customer reallocation program
Fit Criterion:	100% of authorised users with permission to access thereallocation program shall be able to 99% of the time
Originator:	Polly Gray (Domestic ticket sales)
Comments:	[MG] Assumption that 80% is an acceptable value for stakeholders to be satisfied that the functionality is working as expected.
[PSHE] 80% is quite a low acceptable value for access to the program - I think it should be higher as this feature should work a significant majority of the time,
perhaps 95%.
[JC] I think 100% of authorised personnel should be able to access the pool of tickets, the fit criterion I believe should be one of availability, authorised personal can access the ticket reallocation 99% of the time which allows a small 1% window for maintenance.
[MG] I think your'e right JC. I'll change from 80% accessing the reallocation programme . I'll change the type to 12 as well from 15
