REQ-ID: NFR-RF02-karenJ
Description: The selection of the event shall be acknowledged quickly by the system.
Type: 12
Rationale: To initiate the return enabling the users to proceed to the next stage in the returns process (ticket selection), without delay.
Fit Criterion: The response time of the system should take no longer than 0.75 seconds for 95 percent of users and no longer than 1 second for the remainder.

Comments: [karenJ] Created new NFR for functional requirement RF02.
[PSHE] This is a fast fit criterion for a response time which is good for the user experience, however I think it could be more lenient as I believe it would be acceptable for users to wait 3-5 seconds between screens during the returns process.
[PB] RE: [PSHE] , I think the fit criterion is on point, because long response times (3 to 5 seconds), would translate into bad customer experience. Anything above 1 second is very noticable and hitting one second mark shouldn't be that hard.
[PB] I think the rationale could be improved because it's lacking the "why?", as to what's the impact of this delay and why do we care.

Comments: [karenJ] Revised non functional requirement as a result of comments recieved.
Updated rationale: To initiate the return enabling the users to proceed to the next stage in the returns process (ticket selection), without delay.  
Users would expect the selection of the event to be acknowledged immediately and the next page (ticket selection) to be displayed instantly, 
as with most online purchases/returns, they will be accustomed to fast response times.  This is one of multiple stages in the returns process, 
failure to facilitate it quickly may result in a lengthy process and complaints.
Updated fit criterion based on my own thoughts to provide clarity: The customer shall be able to successfully select an event in one single action, 
and the response time of the system should take no longer than 0.75 seconds for 95 percent of users and no longer than 1 second for the remainder.
Comments: [lcm]: Make sure you define over which window the percentiles should be calculated. If latency were to spike briefly, it could violate the constraint, whereas when measured over the course of a month the constraint could still be valid
