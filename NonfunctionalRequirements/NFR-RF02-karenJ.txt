REQ-ID: NFR-RF02-karenJ
Description: The selection of the event shall be acknowledged quickly by the system.
Type: 12
Rationale: To initiate the return enabling the users to proceed to the next stage in the returns process (ticket selection), without delay.
Fit Criterion: The response time of the system should take no longer than 0.75 seconds for 95 percent of users and no longer than 1 second for the remainder.
Originator: Karen Jakes (Project Manager)
Comments: [karenJ] Created new NFR for functional requirement RF02.
		  [PSHE] This is a fast fit criterion for a response time which is good for the user experience, however I think it could be more lenient
		  as I believe it would be acceptable for users to wait 3-5 seconds between screens during the returns process.
		  [PB] RE: [PSHE] , I think the fit criterion is on point, because long response times (3 to 5 seconds), would translate into bad customer experience. 
		  Anything above 1 second is very noticable and hitting one second mark shouldn't be that hard.
		  [PB] I think the rationale could be improved because it's lacking the "why?", as to what's the impact of this delay and why do we care.
