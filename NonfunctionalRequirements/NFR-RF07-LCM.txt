REQ-ID: NFR-RF07-LCM
Description: The latency between a ticket return being confirmed and the user being notified will be low
Type: 12
Rationale: The slow delivery of ticket return confirmations can lead to anxiety and poor user experience for the user. This may increase the load on support staff who must respond to user queries.
Fit Criterion: The time between a ticket return being approved and the notification confirming this to the user leaving the JustTheTicket system shall be lower than 3 seconds for 95 percent of requests, measured on a daily basis.
Originator: Laurie Clark-Michalek (Student)
Comments: [lcm] Created NFR for FR RF07.
[PB] I think you forgot to remove the original Rationale that you have copied. Other than that it looks good to me. [lcm: thanks! removed it now :) ]
[MG] I think the fit criterion is ambiguous as it stands as it's measuring three things - The time between the request being approved and subsequent notification, then the time between receiving this and the user leaving the system. . You could probably drop the latter about leaving the system.
