REQ-ID: NFR-RF03-PB
Description: The customers will be provided with accessible and easy to understand information about ticket return process and deadlines.
Type: Non-Functional
Rationale: To allow customers to get their refunds easily and to help with reallocation of tickets to reduce the number of empty seats.
Fit Criterion: 90% of English and 70% of non-English speakers or readers should find the return process and deadlines easy to understand and follow.
Originator: Polly Gray (Domestic Ticket Sales)
Comments:
[PB] Created new Non-Functional requirement for functional requirement RF03, which should support it,
by reducing the number of invalid ticket return request, reducing the number of potential customer support requests
and to help meet the goal of low number of empty seats.
Comment: [karenJ] Add non-functional requirement type : 11 usability and humanity. Fit criterion: I might expect higher figures 95% English and 80% non-english as english is a common language, perhaps it could be further quantified with the percentage of complaints recieved should not exceed 5%.
Suggestion for more details in the rationale, To enable customers to easily access and understand the ticket return process and eligibility criteria for the return (I'm assuming it will provide a notification or link to view the returns process) enabling a swift return.  Keeping the reallocation part.
