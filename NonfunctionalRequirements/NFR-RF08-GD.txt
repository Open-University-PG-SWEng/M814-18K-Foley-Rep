REQ-ID: NFR-RF08-GD
Description: The re-allocation process must be performant.
Type: 12 - Performance
Rationale: Unallocated tickets could lead to increased amounts of empty seats but because
           the re-allocation process is batched the system must perform adequately well in
           order to be useful.
Fit Criterion: The system must be able to handle at least 1000 ticket re-allocations per run.
Originator: Polly Gray (Domestic Ticket Sales)
Comments:
- [GD] Created NFR-RF08-GD based on RF08.
- [GD] Changed the fit criteria from per day to per run as this decouples the scheduling from the actual execution (we could run this once a week or once an hour depending on demand so the change allows for these extensions without changing its meaning)
