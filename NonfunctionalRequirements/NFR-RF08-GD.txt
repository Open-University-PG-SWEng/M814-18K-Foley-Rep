REQ-ID: NFR-RF08-GD
Description: The re-allocation process must be performant.
Type: 12 - Performance
Rationale: Unallocated tickets could lead to increased amounts of empty seats but because
           the re-allocation process is batched the system must perform adequately well in
           order to be useful.
Fit Criterion: The system must be able to handle at least 1000 ticket re-allocations per day.
