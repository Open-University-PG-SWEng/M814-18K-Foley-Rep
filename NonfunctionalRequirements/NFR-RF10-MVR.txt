REQ-ID: NFR-RF10-MVR

Fit Criterion: Nine out of ten customers shall be able to complete the account registration in less than five minutes, and the customer needs to be able to click on register within ten mouse clicks.

[WH] The second part of your fit criterion, ability to click on register within 10 clicks. Shouldn't there be a button or link on the initial landing page that would take customers to the registration page/system directly? This would reduce the clicks to register from 10 to 1. Or is the 10 clicks the total number of clicks to complete registration. 
Comments: [JS] First part of the fit criterion sounds reasonable. However, with regards to the latter part - do you mean to initiate registration within ten clicks, or to complete the registration in ten clicks? If it is to initiate the registration, ten clicks seems excessive and the user is likely to get frustrated and give up - I would be inclined to limit it to 2 or 3. If it's about the completion of the registration - then 10 sounds reasonable.
