[WH] The second part of your fit criterion, ability to click on register within 10 clicks. Shouldn't there be a button or link on the initial landing page that would take customers to the registration page/system directly? This would reduce the clicks to register from 10 to 1. Or is the 10 clicks the total number of clicks to complete registration.
