Comments: [CH] Created new NFR for functional requirement RF04.
[PB] That's not a non-functional requirement. The description indicates a specific required functionality "collate and store reasons". I would redo it.
Comments: I agree that this is not a non functional requirment. I would improve the requirement by making it measurable eg the speed at which the information should be processed. the product should be able to look for potential patterns within 2 minutes of analysing the data.
