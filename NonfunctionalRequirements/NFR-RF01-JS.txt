Description: The product shall make it easy for an average customer to initiate the return of tickets.

Comments: [JS] Created a non-functional requirement related to RF01.
[JC] I like this fit criterion it allow the developers to create a test case in advance of development and provides quantifiable metrics that allows a test to easily pass.
