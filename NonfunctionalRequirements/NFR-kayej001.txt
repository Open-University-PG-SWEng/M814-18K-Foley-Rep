Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[JC] The original functional requirement is not stated in the filename which effects the traceability.
[JC] For the fit criterion I believe that 90% of users should select a default return reason, with 10% creating their own reason in addition to the time limit. This assumes that the functionality exists for them to tailor their return reason. 

Comments: [SM] This is a 'usability and humanity' NFR. In my opinion, the fit criterion should focus on providing a comprehensive list of reasons for return along with a 'other' selection where the user can type the reason. The user can take a lot less or a lot more time on this screen as this is purely customer driven (You can't hurry them. However, a session timeout may kick in to counter long period of inactivity.)Probable fit criterion: at least 95% of users can select from a list of reasons provided and the remaining have the option of selecting 'other' option and typing their reason.

Comments:[KJ] I have looked at the previous comments and changed the Requirment ID to reflect the functional requirment also updated the type and modified the fit criterion and Rationale to make more clear the options for the customer
