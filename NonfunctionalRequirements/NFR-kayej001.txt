Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[JC] The original functional requirement is not stated in the filename which effects the traceability.
[JC] For the fit criterion I believe that 90% of users should select a default return reason, with 10% creating their own reason in addition to the time limit. This assumes that the functionality exists for them to tailor their return reason.
